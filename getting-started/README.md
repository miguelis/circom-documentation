# Getting started

In this chapter, we prepare the reader to get started using circom:

* [Installing circom 2.0](installation.md) on Linux.
* [Writing your first program](our-first-circom-program.md) using the main features of circom: [signals](../intro/common-programming-concepts/signals/), [variables](../intro/common-programming-concepts/signals/variables-and-mutability.md), [templates,](../intro/common-programming-concepts/template/) [components,](../intro/common-programming-concepts/template/) and [arrays](../intro/common-programming-concepts/data-types.md).
* [Writing your second program](our-second-circom-program.md) using other important features of circom: [constraints](../intro/common-programming-concepts/constraint-generation.md), [signal tags](../intro/common-programming-concepts/signals/)
* [Compiling a program and genereting zero-knowledge proof](our-first-zero-knowledge-proof.md) using `snarksjs`.
* [Writing a simple elliptic curve](the-baby-jubjub-elliptic-curve.md), called baby jubjub, from the circom library.
