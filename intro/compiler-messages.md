# Compiler messages

The compiler messages are basically of three kinds: hints, warnings and errors.

## A hint

This message means that it is allowed but uncommon, and hence it is better to check if it was done on purpose.

## A warning

This message means that it is allowed but should not happen in general.

## An error

This message means that it is not allowed.
